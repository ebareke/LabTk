# LabTk

LabTk is a set of bioinformatics workflows used in our lab. It currently supports various types of next generation sequencing data analysis, including (but not limited to). 

  - Genetic analyses (Exome, Genome, HLA-Typing, ...)
  - Transcriptomic analyses (RNASeq, microRNA, Single Cell RNASeq, ...)
  - Epigenetics analyses (ChIPseq, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing, ...)

# Additional Features!

  - We provide student with introductory sessions on programming (Bash, R, Python)
  - And a series of R codes for various types of data analyses are provided


You can also:
  - Ask specific analysis questions
  - Propose aspects you would like us to cover here
  - Request help on complex issues, not necessary covered here.
